<p>Finding an artist for your projects can be confusing, digging through contacts, tags on social media, and numerous websites. Hashtags can often be inconsistent or overloaded with bots. CreatorList.art makes this process easier by compiling listings from a variety of artists, offering as much detail in one place as possible.</p>

<p>CreatorList.art solely exists to provide information. We do not take payments on our platform, nor do we offer in-house communication tools. There is no expectation to sign up or pay us fees to access services. We raise funds through advertising and sponsorships, not user subscriptions.</p>

<p>Commission data is only collected when an artist opts-in to provide it. If your data is on the database without your consent, please contact us immediately.</p>
