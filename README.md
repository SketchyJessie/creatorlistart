Sample webpage for a project pitched at Kanasas State University. This isn't an existing business, and all information within the webpage is fake. Will be further updated in the future to demonstrate web development skills as I learn them.

List of what I intend to work on:
- Python scripting
- Database functionality and security (SQL)
- Mobile-friendly/accessible design (CSS improvements)
- Functional forms (ideally with something that scrambles inputs to prevent any real data being sent)
